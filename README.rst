gumpy-realtime
==============

This repository contains scripts to use ``gumpy`` in real-time scenarios. This
is, for instance, the case when you want to perform live recording or decoding
of EEG/EMG signals.

Note that the code is already usable, but may not yet be production quality.

Contributing
============

If you wish to contribute to ``gumpy``'s development then clone the appropriate
repository from github and start coding, test if everything works as expected,
and finally submit patches or open merge requests. Preferrably in this order.

Please try to follow PEP8, or have a look at the formatting of gumpy's code, and
include proper documentation both in your commit messages as well as the source
code.
